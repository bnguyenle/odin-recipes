    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 T-Bone or porterhouse steak, at least 3 inches thick and 3 pounds</li>
      <li>1 bunch fresh rosemary</li>
      <li>1 bunch fresh sage</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat a grill pan on medium-high heat. Pat the steak dry, and season both sides generously with salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>Tie the rosemary and sage bunches together with butcherâ€™s twine to form an herb brush. Use the herbs to brush the steak with olive oil.</li>
      <li>Place the steak on the grill pan, and char it well: cook about 12 minutes on the first side, flip, and cook about 9 minutes on the second side. Like we said earlier, this steak is traditionally served rare.</li>
      <li>When the steak is done, remove it from the grill pan and allow it to stand for 5 minutes so that the juices are retained when the meat is cut. Carve off the fillet and strip steaks, and slice before serving. Serve hot, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
