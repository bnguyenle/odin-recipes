    <h3>Tomato Bruschetta</h3>
    <p>This classic recipe is for lazy summer days that beg for moving slowly and snacking often. This bruschetta gets better as it sits for a bit, so make it up to an hour ahead. While most bruschetta recipes have you rub a raw garlic clove on toasted bread, this one calls for making a quick infused oil that’s stirred into the tomatoes and basil, providing a more delicate garlicky note. Pile it all on toasted bread, and enjoy bite after juicy bite.</p>

      <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Core and chop the tomatoes, then transfer to a colander over a bowl or in the sink. Add the salt and gently stir. Let drain for up to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the garlic oil: In a small saucepan, warm the olive oil and garlic over low heat until the garlic is softened and fragrant, about 5 minutes, making sure the garlic doesn’t brown. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Roll the basil leaves up and thinly slice crosswise.</li>
        <li>When the oil is cool and the tomatoes are well drained, combine the tomatoes, garlic oil and basil in a medium bowl. Season with additional salt, to taste. Spoon over toasted bread.</li>
      </ol>
